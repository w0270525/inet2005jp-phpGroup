AARON ALI
I added some controllers and models for each of the classes. If you set
the project to run and point it at the development folder you should be ale to see
some unfinished html tables returning the values from the CMS data base for each of the major CMS tables.
Getting a page from all this information should'nt be to hard now.


DUE MONDAY
REQ-008   Display of Generated Website (6 pts.)
Users navigating to the front-end site in a web browser will be presented with a website,
dynamically created from the pages, content areas, articles, and currently active CSS template
defined in the CMS database. A menu with appropriate hyperlinks will be added to every page allowing
 for complete navigation of the site. If multiple articles are currently defined in the database for
  a particular content area on a particular page, newer articles will show up first/on top in that area.
All users will be able to display the basic site without having to log in.
NOTE: IN ORDER TO TEST THIS REQUIREMENT DURING THE CODE REVIEW AT LEAST FOUR PAGES, EACH
WITH AT LEAST FOUR CONTENT AREAS, EACH WITH AT LEAST ONE ARTICLE (i.e. AN ARTICLE IN ALL
CONTENT AREAS ON ALL PAGES) WILL NEED TO ALREADY BE CREATED WITH SUFFICIENT TEXT TO LOOK
PRESENTABLE. LOREM IPSUM TEXT FROM A SITE SUCH AS http://www.lipsum.com/ IS ACCEPTABLE.
YOU WILL ALSO NEED TWO CSS TEMPLATES PREDEFINED WITH DIFFEREING STYLES SO WE CAN TEST
 SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO.


REQ-0020 Entity Relationship Diagram for Custom CMS Database (5 pts.)
An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) document will be created for the MySQL database to support
the custom CMS web application. The document will use Crowâ€™s Feet Notation. All entities and
relationships will be reflected in the document. All relevant fields, data types, and keys will be
appropriately indicated.

REQ-0021 MySQL Workbench Data Model (5 pts.)
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) document described in RE-0020 above should be implemented
 as a MySQL Workbench Data Model. The model should be added to Source Control (see REQ-0022) and
 sample data should be included in this model. With sample data included, you will generate a sample
 database to use for development.
